The message was simple: "Not all truths were buried, some were shelved."\n\nFollowing the faint trail of penciled margins and forgotten donor names, Nora uncovered a kindness long mistaken for scandal, and a promise kept in silence. By closing time, the library felt lighter, as if the books themselves were relieved. And Nora smiled, knowing that sometimes mysteries asked not to be solved, but to be understood.`;
